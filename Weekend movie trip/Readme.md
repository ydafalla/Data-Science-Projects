Data Clustering Project

WEEKEND MOVIE TRIP

## Introduction:

The project is about building a clustering model to determine similar moves  to recommend using the ratings and tags by other users as features.

The data was obatined from the following link:

Data Source: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ small data set

The data are contained in the files links.csv, movies.csv, ratings.csv and tags.csv.

## Approach:

This notebook is a movie recommendation model using K-means clustering (to recommend similar movies to the user). The two features extracted from the dataset include: Average Movie Rating and Tags. The number of clusters was chosen to be 5 and the clustering was based on the Average Movie Rating and Tags.

## Discussion:
K-means clustering was used to recommend similar movies to users. The clustering was based on the Average Movie Ratings and Tags. The clusters of similar movies was put together and the top 20 movies in each cluster was printed.
