Regression Project


## Introduction:
The project is about building a regression model to determine the score of each team using other columns as features.

The data was obatined from the following link:

https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/soccer-spi

The data are contained in the files lspi_global_rankings.csv, spi_global_rankings_intl.csv, spi_matches.csv.

## Approach:
The basic approach is to use linear regression in order to predict the scores using other column features.
